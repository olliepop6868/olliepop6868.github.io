              <h4>A little about me</h4>
              My name is Miss Ollie. Iâ€™m in my second year in Kindergarten and Elementary Education.
              I see myself teaching science, English language arts, media and technology, and math.
              I see myself continuing my education either to become an educational psychologist who
              can test and diagnose children with learning disabilities, to go to philosophical dialogue
              training and hold my own discussions in class.<br/><br/>

              What brought me to education: As a child, I had to work super hard for my mark and to learn.
              I wanted to become a teacher to help the students who may fall between the cracks, who may
              have a slight to severe learning disability. I also chose teaching because I like helping
              others, teaching, sharing, creating, and playing.<br/><br/>

              However, the one moment that made me realize that I want to help people was when I was in 
              Cegep as a para-technician working at Dawson in Cinema/Communications as part of the Creative 
              Arts Language and Literature. I would be paid through the school to stay after hours in the Mac 
              computer labs to help students with technical and brain storming questions regarding their 
              projects. One day, a student came in. He was different than many other students. He would 
              speak very slowly, be enthusiastic but the way with which he would express his ideas would 
              come across as incoherent. When we would suggest to him ideas, he would say he understood 
              but his actions showed otherwise. When he came into my lab, I helped him edit his video. 
              He would verbalize to me what he wanted to do and I would model to him how to do it using 
              Final Cut 10. It took time, patience. We finished the project and he was so grateful. 
              This experience made me feel as though I have a positive impact helping others create 
              and learn.<br/><br/>
